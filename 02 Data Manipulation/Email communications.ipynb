    "E-mail continues to serve as a foundational tool for communication in both personal and professional settings. It remains the primary means of asynchronous communication alongside instant messaging applications and shares platforms like documents or project management tools. Unlike those tools, which vary by organization, e-mail is a universal standard across businesses and individuals.\n",
    "From the customer’s standpoint, the e-mail address functions as a unique identifier across digital platforms. Most online services use e-mails to create and manage user accounts. In the absence of a global identification system, the e-mail address, together with the phone number, has become the de facto method for tracking user identity.\n",
    "Businesses also leverage e-mail to communicate effectively with customers, often through automated workflows. These include transactional messages like order confirmations, password resets, or renewal reminders. Marketing automation can drive sales with personalized messages such as cart abandonment alerts or promotional campaigns. Scheduled newsletters further reinforce customer engagement, offering updates, content, and promotions aligned with the brand’s identity and offerings.\n",
    "Within organizations, e-mail is extensively used to align teams, coordinate initiatives, and maintain records of decisions. It provides a formal channel that supports traceability and accountability in business processes. E-mails and document approvals often serve as a historical reference for ongoing or completed projects. For many teams, it remains the preferred method of asynchronous communication."

    "E-mail users typically access their accounts through a desktop or mobile application, or via a web-based interface provided by their service provider. These interfaces connect to mail servers to manage the sending and receiving of messages.\n",
    "When a user clicks \"Send\" on the interface, SMTP is activated. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) transmits the message to an outgoing mail server, which is responsible for routing the e-mail through one or more intermediate servers until it reaches the recipient's domain mail server. During this process, the Domain Name System (DNS) plays a crucial role by translating the domain name (e.g., iese.edu) into an IP address, allowing the system to locate the correct destination server. To initiate this connection, the mail application must be configured with the correct server address and the port number the server listens to (for more details about port usage, research Transmission Control Protocol).\n",
    "When the mail application or the user initiates a check for new messages, the client connects to the incoming mail server of the user’s e-mail provider. Two primary protocols are used for this purpose: Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).\n",
    "- POP3 downloads e-mails from the server to the user's local device and, by default, deletes them from the server after downloading them. This approach reduces server storage demands but limits access to messages to a single device, which can be problematic in business environments where multi-device access is essential.\n",
    "- IMAP synchronizes e-mails between the server and all connected devices. This ensures messages remain accessible from multiple platforms, making IMAP the preferred protocol for most professional and enterprise use cases.\n",
    "For enhanced security, these mail transmission protocols are often combined with encryption standards such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its more modern successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS). These protocols provide a security layer that includes encryption, server authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality, protecting sensitive information from interception or tampering during transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every e-mail is structured into three main components: the header, body, and optional attachments. The header contains metadata including sender and recipient addresses (e.g., “To:” and “CC:” fields), the subject line, and the date. The body contains the actual message content, which can be written in plain text or enriched using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to support formatting, images, and hyperlinks. When sending images, multimedia, or characters beyond the ASCII range (basic set of 127 characters), e-mails rely on the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) standard to encode and format these elements for transmission."
