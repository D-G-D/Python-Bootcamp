    "## About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** This data contains public information about the crashes resulting in an injury in the City of San Francisco. The data was pulled from `TransBASE.sfgov.org` in July 2024. There are several types of report; this data is based on the \"Traffic Crashes Resulting in Injury: Parties Involved\" found in https://data.sfgov.org/d/8gtc-pjc6/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**: Some columns from the original data were dropped. For those remaining, data were modified to group values that had very similar or the same meaning. The resulting data is available on GitHub `https://github.com/D-G-D/Python/blob/main/Data/sf_traffic.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data format**: Each row of the data contains the information about a party involved in an accident. The row contains also information about the accident itself, that is the same for all parties (for example: the road where the accident occurred). The following columns are available: \n",
